# Web extension

A web extension was programed for geotrouvetout so it can be accessed in an easier manner and used in game.

To get the extension, please read the installation guide. To use it, you can start a game on [geoguessr.com](geoguessr.com). In the top left corner, you will see a locate button, when you press it, the image on your screen will be sent to a server on which geotrouvetout's REST API is running. The result will be sent back, processed and displayed on your screen as a notification on the top center of the screen.
